Explanation:
run: block: I used a pipe (|) to start a multi-line string for the run command. This allows each Maven option to be placed on a new line for readability.
Escaping special characters: In YAML, commas and other special characters can be misinterpreted. By placing everything inside a multi-line string, these issues are avoided.
This should resolve your syntax error while preserving the correct configuration for the Maven and SonarCloud analysis.

The error message suggests that SonarCloud could not find a default branch for the project with key 'com.boracompany:mygame'. This might happen due to several reasons, such as the project not being properly set up on SonarCloud, or the branch name not matching the default branch on SonarCloud.

Potential Fixes:
Ensure the SonarCloud project exists:

Make sure that the project with the key com.boracompany:mygame is set up in SonarCloud. The key should be exactly as configured in your repository and SonarCloud.
Ensure that the projectKey in your configuration matches the one defined in SonarCloud.
Default Branch Configuration:

Ensure that the branch you're pushing to (in this case, main) is the default branch on SonarCloud.
If main is not the default branch, either change your GitHub Action to work on the default branch of SonarCloud or configure SonarCloud to use main as the default branch.
Correct the Project Key:

Based on the provided YAML snippet, the project key appears as BoraArseven_MyGame in your run step but is referenced as com.boracompany:mygame in the error. Ensure that the project key in the configuration matches exactly what SonarCloud expects.
Update the project key to match SonarCloud's configuration.
Command Formatting Issue:

There is a formatting issue in the Maven run command. The -Dsonar.projectKey=BoraArseven_MyGame parameter should be preceded by a hyphen (-), and you missed the - at the beginning of Dsonar.projectKey.
Suggested Workflow After Fixes:
